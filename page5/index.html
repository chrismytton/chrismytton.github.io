<p>We had a bank holiday in the UK on Monday and the weather has been lovely, so I’ve been outdoors harvesting vegetables. Our courgettes have done really well this year. I think putting them in the ground and underplanting them with white clover has helped the nitrogen levels in the soil, which means the plants are big and have lush green leaves.</p>

<h2 id="solitude">Solitude</h2>

<p>I’m reading <a href="http://www.calnewport.com/books/digital-minimalism/">Digital Minimalism</a> by Cal Newport at the moment. One section of the book talks about the importance of solitude, which Cal defines as “a subjective state in which your mind is free from input from other minds”. He argues solitude is disappearing in modern life because we’re so addicted to our smartphones. We fill moments where we used to be alone with our thoughts with a quick check of social media. The book suggests three practices that can help us reclaim some solitude in our lives.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Leave your phone at home sometimes, you’ll be fine.</li>
  <li>Go for long walks, preferably without your phone.</li>
  <li>Write down your thoughts using pen and paper.</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="gut-facts">Gut facts</h2>

<p>I read <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23013953-gut">Gut: The Inside Story of Our Body’s Most Underrated Organ</a> by Giulia Enders earlier this month. It’s a fascinating look at the internal workings of something we use every day but probably don’t give much thought to, our gut. Here are some interesting facts I learned while reading it:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Squatting results in better bowel movements than sitting. You can help your bowel movements by leaning forward slightly and putting your feet on a small footstool.</li>
  <li>Alcohol can multiply the number of gas-producing bacteria by a factor of up to a thousand.</li>
  <li>Tummies rumble between meals not because you’re hungry but because you’ve left enough time between meals for your small intestine and stomach to do some cleaning.</li>
  <li>Bacteria do more than just break down our food. They also produce completely new substances. Fresh cabbage, for example, is less rich in vitamins than the sauerkraut it can be turned into.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="english-cricket">English cricket</h2>

<p>Finally I just wanted to mention what an exciting summer it has been for English cricket. First the unbelievable world cup final, including <em>that</em> super over. Who could have predicted a drawn match and a drawn super over, which meant the cricket world cup was decided by which team got the most boundaries. Poor New Zealand though, you have to feel for them. I hope in the future they modify the rules so that the teams keep playing super overs until there is a clear winner.</p>

<p>Then Ben Stokes’ incredible innings at Headingley last week in The Ashes third test, just 6 weeks after the world cup final, to take a monumental victory that seemed all but impossible after England went all out for 67 in their first innings. Hopefully the English batting lineup can take some tips from the way Stokes approached the innings. Defensive at first, not taking any risks, then building up to the point where every other ball was a boundary.</p>

    <p class="post-date">Saturday 3 August 2019</p>
  </header>

  <div class="post-content">
    
<p>It’s still surprisingly hard to find restaurants that serve organic food. So I was delighted to discover The Looking Glass in Cheltenham not only does organic food but they also make everything in-house and they’re open for breakfast.</p>

<p>The restaurant feels much more spacious on the inside than it looks through the window. There are lots of succulents dotted around the restaurant, along with a smattering of mirrors and flamingo statues. Just the right amount of whimsy for my tastes.</p>

<p>Ordered my usual decaf flat white. It didn’t look like the best coffee when it arrived, but the flavour was good. I didn’t come for the coffee though, I came for the food.</p>

<p>I ordered the Full English so I could get a measure of the place. When it came out the plate looked amazing. The eggs had bright orange yolks, the sausage was plump, the bacon crispy and the beans rustic. Apparently the mushrooms are foraged locally. They certainly looked impressive, lots of different colours and shapes, a far cry from the usual sad looking pile of button mushrooms.</p>

<p>The flavour didn’t dissapoint either. Everything on the plate was cooked to perfection, and tasted incredible. I polished off every last morsel. The Looking Glass offers incredibly tasty food at a reasonable price. Well worth a visit if you like your food sustainable and delicious.</p>

    <p class="post-date">Sunday 14 October 2018</p>
  </header>

  <div class="post-content">
    
<p>The web is full of distractions: adverts, news, social media, email. It can sometimes be hard to remember why you opened the browser in the first place. Even opening a new tab is distracting. You see bookmarks, a search box and frequently visited sites before you’ve even begun the task you went on the web for.</p>

<p>I wanted to go back to the days where you could have “about:blank” as your new tab and it would show you a plain white page. Like a fresh sheet of paper waiting for you to write on.</p>

<p>If you use Firefox or Safari then you can go into the settings and select “Blank Page” (Firefox) or “Empty Page” (Safari) and that’s it, job done. But Google Chrome doesn’t let you do that. Instead you have to use an extension.</p>

<p>I tried some of the existing extensions, but they turned out to be <em>too</em> blank. They didn’t feel like native tabs. There were two features in particular that I wanted but none of the existing extensions offered.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Background colour should be the same off-white as other Chrome screens such as “Settings” and “Extensions”.</li>
  <li>It should have the same title as the default new tab, i.e. “New tab”, rather than “chrome://newtab”.</li>
</ol>

<p>There was no alternative, I was going to have to create my own blank new tab extension. As a bonus writing my own extension meant I didn’t have to worry about scammers taking over one of the other “blank new tab” extensions and mining bitcoin in my browser. <sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote">1</a></sup></p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/distraction-free-new-tab.png" alt="Screenshot of the Chrome Extension in action" /></p>

<p>The extension is two lines of HTML and the required <code class="highlighter-rouge">manifest.json</code> file. The code is open source, so you can review it and check I’m not mining bitcoin in your browser.</p>

<p>Get the code <a href="https://github.com/chrismytton/blanktab">on GitHub</a> and enjoy a less distracting web.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Even though the UNIX system introduces a number of innovative programs and techniques, no single program or idea makes it work well. Instead, what makes it effective is the approach to programming, a philosophy of using the computer. Although that philosophy can’t be written down in a single sentence, at its heart is the idea that <strong>the power of a system comes more from the relationships among programs than from the programs themselves</strong>. Many UNIX programs do quite trivial things in isolation, but, combined with other programs, become general and useful tools. <sup id="fnref:unix-programming-environment"><a href="#fn:unix-programming-environment" class="footnote">1</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>

<p>This also applies to object-oriented programming, where the power of a system comes from the messages sent between objects, rather than from the objects themselves.</p>

<p>Keep your objects and programs simple, then combine them into more complex and powerful systems.</p>

<p>You’ve got to slow down if you want to go further.</p>

<p>Performance varies from day to day, sometimes 30 minutes seems easy and flashes by, other times you want to give up in the first 10 minutes.</p>

<p>Regular practice is how you get better, there are no shortcuts.</p>

<p>Pushing through when it gets hard is how major gains are made.</p>

    <p class="post-date">Wednesday 15 August 2018</p>
  </header>

  <div class="post-content">
    
<p>I created this little shell pipeline to help me see the total amount given to or received from people and companies using my data in <a href="https://www.youneedabudget.com/">YNAB</a>.</p>

<p>I used the new <a href="https://api.youneedabudget.com/">YNAB API</a>, <a href="https://stedolan.github.io/jq/">jq</a> and <a href="https://harelba.github.io/q/">q</a> to get a CSV out. It’s not perfect as it includes the “Transfer: Bank Account” payees, but it’s good enough for my purposes.</p>

<p>First set an access token in the environment.  You can get an access token from <a href="https://app.youneedabudget.com/settings/developer">https://app.youneedabudget.com/settings/developer</a>.</p>

<div class="language-shell highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="nb">export </span><span class="nv">YNAB_ACCESS_TOKEN</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s1">'...'</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Then you can run the pipeline, which <em>should</em> default to your last-used budget. This outputs a CSV where the first column is the payee name and the second column is the total amount paid to that payee (if negative) or received from that payee (if positive).</p>

<div class="language-shell highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>curl <span class="nt">-H</span> <span class="s2">"Authorization: Bearer </span><span class="nv">$YNAB_ACCESS_TOKEN</span><span class="s2">"</span> https://api.youneedabudget.com/v1/budgets/last-used/transactions <span class="se">\</span>
  | jq <span class="nt">-r</span> <span class="s1">'.data.transactions | .[] | [.payee_name,.amount] | @csv'</span> <span class="se">\</span>
  | q <span class="nt">-d</span>, <span class="s1">'select c1, sum(c2)/1000.0 as total from - group by c1 order by total'</span>
