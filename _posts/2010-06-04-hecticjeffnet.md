This blog now lives at a new address, [hecticjeff.net][]. If you're reading this then you are already here! I'm still using [heroku][] to host the blog, it's quite simply the best (only?) way to host ruby apps in the cloud. If you want to get in touch you can now email me on __self at hecticjeff dot net__.

The blog is going to get some love soon, comments will be the first thing to activate, as I'm using the excellent [toto][] from cloudhead I will most likely opt for the wonderful [Disqus][disqus] comment system. That's priority 1. Priority 0 is to write some more posts, but I've been settling into a new job (with the awesome [Simpleweb][] crew) in a new city (Bristol) recently, so this blog has been neglected to say the least. But it's time has come.
