title: Banana Bread

This recipe is an adaptation of [How to cook perfect banana bread by Felicity Cloake](https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/wordofmouth/2012/aug/30/how-to-cook-perfect-banana-bread). The original recipe makes great banana bread, but some of the quantities and instructions irk me. This is my slightly edited version so I can refer back to it in the future.

I've changed the amount of butter to be a weight, rather than tablespoons, I've also given the number of bananas as well as the peeled weight. With the instructions I've shuffled the order around a bit and removed the sifting step as I find it doesn't make much difference. Enjoy!

- 160g soft, light brown sugar
- 2 eggs, beaten
- 60g melted butter, plus extra to grease, slightly cooled
- 4 ripe bananas, mashed (roughly 350g peeled weight)
- 180g plain flour, plus extra for the tin
- 2.5 tsp baking powder
- 1 tsp salt
- 50g walnuts, roughly chopped (optional)

1. Preheat the oven to 170C. Grease and lightly flour a loaf tin about 21x9x7cm.

2. Put the sugar, eggs and melted butter in a large bowl and whisk them until pale and slightly increased in volume.

3. Fold the mashed bananas, flour, baking powder and salt into the sugar and egg mixture until you can see no more flour, then fold in the walnuts.

4. Spoon into the tin and bake for about an hour until a skewer inserted into the middle comes out clean. Cool in the tin for 10 minutes before turning out on to a rack to cool completely.
