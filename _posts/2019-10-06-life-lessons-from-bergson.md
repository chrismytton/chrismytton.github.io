I read [Life Lessons from Bergson](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18680879-life-lessons-from-bergson) by Michael Foley a few months ago. It was an OK book, nothing outstanding, but there were a couple of good quotes that I wrote in my notebook that are worth sharing.

> Refusing to learn anything new is a major cause of petrifaction.

> It is not what we feel and think that guides what we do, but what we do that guides what we feel and think.
