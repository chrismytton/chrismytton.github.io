I enjoy chopping wood, it gives me an excuse to get out in the fresh air, and depending on how much I chop it can be a pretty good workout.

There's also something quite therapeutic about squaring up to the chopping block with an axe. It requires a decent amount of concentration, so my mind doesn't have time to wander, yet it combines just the right amount of challenge and repetition to get into a state of flow.

I think 30 minutes spent chopping wood is as good for your brain as 30 minutes spent meditating.
