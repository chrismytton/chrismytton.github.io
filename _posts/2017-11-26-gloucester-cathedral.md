We visited [Gloucester Cathedral](http://www.gloucestercathedral.org.uk/) yesterday. The cathedral is over 1000 years old and is built in a mix Romanesque and Gothic style architecture. It has a stained glass window that depicts the earliest known images of golf that dates from 1350, sadly I didn't get a picture of it.

They're currently doing some work around the cathedral as part of [Project Pilgrim](http://www.gloucestercathedral.org.uk/project-pilgrim/). This is one of the unfinished stones depicting Saint Benedict which is going to make up part of a new seating area outside the cathedral.

The cathedral's magnificent cloisters. Used as a filming location in a few of the Harry Potter films.
