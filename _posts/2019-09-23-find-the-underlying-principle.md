It's tempting when solving a problem to use the first solution that works and move on. Indeed with deadlines and external pressures this often feels like the only choice.

But if possible it's worth taking the time to understand the problem at a deeper level. Understand what the underlying principle is. When you understand this you can understand what a more elegant solution to the problem will look like.
