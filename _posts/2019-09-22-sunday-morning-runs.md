I find it incredibly theraputic going for a run early on a Sunday morning. I like to go out just as the sun is rising, around 7am this time of year, but before the roads are filled with cars, noise and pollution.

These runs are about more than just exercise. They're about finding space and time away from the everyday hustle and bustle to just exist. There's no pressure to do anything other than put one foot in front of the other.

It's on these runs in the small hours of Sunday morning where I most often get into a state of flow. I stop noticing the effort required and just enjoy the run. They're also a great time to enjoy solitude, which helps me process my thoughts and emotions.
