This is my summary of the recommendations at the end of [Unhappy Meals by Michael Pollan](https://michaelpollan.com/articles-archive/unhappy-meals/).

- Eat real food that people 2000 years ago would have recognised as food
- Avoid foods that have health claims
- Don't buy things with unfamiliar or unpronounceable ingredients
- Ideally don't buy anything with an ingredients list
- Shop organically, sustainably and locally rather than going to the supermarket
- Pay more, eat less
- Eat until you are 80% full
- Eat mostly plants, especially leaves
- Flexitarians are as healthy as vegetarians
- Eat in more traditional ways, as cultures historically have
- Cook your own food
- Grow your own food
- Eat a wide variety of foods
