Being ill is rubbish, but when you come out the other side it can make you feel grateful that things are back to normal.

Before you got ill, normal might have been stressful or boring. But after the lows of illness, when your body aches and you feel like you have no energy or drive, it's a relief to finally be better and back to normality. You see life with a new positivity.
