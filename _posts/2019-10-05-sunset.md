I relish a good sunset.

The dramatic dimming horizon when the skies have been blue. That burst of intense colour that occurs when there are enough clouds to provide a canvas. Or the slow menacing darkness when a stormy afternoon turns into a stormy night. They're all beautiful in their own way, and they all remind us of the rhythm of the day.

Months, weeks, hours, minutes and seconds - these are all humans inventions. But days are more natural. You can see the sunrise and sunset and know that another day has passed.

On good days you can watch the sunset and [enjoy what is, before it isn't]({% post_url 2019-10-02-enjoy-life %}). On the not-so-good days you can watch the sunset and know that this day is nearly over, and tomorrow is a fresh start.
