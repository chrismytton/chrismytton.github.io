You've got to slow down if you want to go further.

Performance varies from day to day, sometimes 30 minutes seems easy and flashes by, other times you want to give up in the first 10 minutes.

Regular practice is how you get better, there are no shortcuts.

Pushing through when it gets hard is how major gains are made.
