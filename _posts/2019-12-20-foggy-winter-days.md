![Sandford Park with low lying fog](/assets/images/foggy-sandford-park.jpg)

Saw some beautiful low-lying fog over the park the other day. You can get fog at all times of year, but there's something particularly enchanting about seeing fog on a cold winters day.

I like the mystery of fog. You don't know what might be happening beyond the fog. You are forced to exist in a kind of temporary bubble, where you can only see as far the the fog permits.
