Not everything you do has to have a reason or purpose behind it. Sometimes it's fun to do something that serves no practical purpose.

Do some drawing, painting, knitting, woodworking, stargazing, writing, bookbinding or whatever. You don't always need to share it on Instagram or sell it on Etsy. Do it simply because you enjoy doing it.
