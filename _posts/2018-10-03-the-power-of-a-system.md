> Even though the UNIX system introduces a number of innovative programs and techniques, no single program or idea makes it work well. Instead, what makes it effective is the approach to programming, a philosophy of using the computer. Although that philosophy can't be written down in a single sentence, at its heart is the idea that **the power of a system comes more from the relationships among programs than from the programs themselves**. Many UNIX programs do quite trivial things in isolation, but, combined with other programs, become general and useful tools. [^unix-programming-environment]

This also applies to object-oriented programming, where the power of a system comes from the messages sent between objects, rather than from the objects themselves.

Keep your objects and programs simple, then combine them into more complex and powerful systems.
