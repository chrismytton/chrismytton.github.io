> It gets easier. Every day it gets a little easier. But you've got to do it every day. That's the hard part. But it does get easier.

-- Jogging Baboon from Bojack Horseman

The Jogging Baboon says this to Bojack after Bojack has collapsed while running in "Out to Sea" (S02E12), right at the end of the episode, which is also the end of season 2.

I think this quote applies to learning all kinds of new skill. Persistence pays off.
