When starting a new project it's tempting to reach for a web framework straight away. But I think it's good to resist that urge. Start with the simplest thing that could possibly work. Start with the command line.


If you start with the command line then you can cut straight to the heart of the problem and solve the interesting bits first. Then once you understand what's needed it can be translated to a web app or smartphone app or whatever.
