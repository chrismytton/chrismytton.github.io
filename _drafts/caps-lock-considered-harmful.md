title: CAPS LOCK CONSIDERED HARMFUL
---

I don't use my caps lock key as a caps lock key, I use it as an escape key and a control key. As a vim user this is very handy because escape is the primary way to switch between vim's insert mode (where you do the typing) and normal mode (where you do the moving around and entering commands). Having it as a control key is also very handy because it can be hard to hit on a Mac laptop because the fn key gets in the way.
