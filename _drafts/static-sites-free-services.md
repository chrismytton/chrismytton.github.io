Static sites are great because they allow you to host stuff basically for free. The only remaining problem is that to get SSL on these sites usually costs some kind of money. All this could be helped by https://letsencrypt.org and others. We need a way to allow people to host static sites, on CDNs, with SSL, for free. This puts the power of sharing information back into people's hands. But the problem with all this is that it's too hard for people to get setup into the first place
