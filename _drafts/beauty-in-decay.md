![Rusty abandoned farm equipment in a field with a backdrop of hills](/assets/images/beauty-in-decay.jpg)

I stumbled across this piece of abandoned farm equipment in a field today while out walking.

One part of me sees this as a sad monument to the failure of humans to tidy up after themselves. A timely metaphor for the wider problems facing Earth.

But from another perspective there's a beauty to this scene. I find myself intrigued and wanting to know more.

What's the story behind this piece of machinery? Where did it come from? How did it end up rusting in the corner of a field?
