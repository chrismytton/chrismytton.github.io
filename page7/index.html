<p>A couple of weeks ago we brewed our first ever batch of beer. Rather than start with something simple like an extract brew, I decided to create my own <a href="http://www.brewtoad.com/recipes/bs5-ipa">all-grain American IPA recipe</a>. The beer is ready to be bottled now, then it will need another 2 weeks in the bottles for conditioning. By mid-January we will finally be able to taste it, hopefully it will at least resemble drinkable beer.</p>

    <p class="post-date">Wednesday 17 July 2013</p>

  <div class="post-content">
    
<p><a href="http://golang.org/">Go</a> is a great language for building network based applications. It comes
with some excellent tools for creating web-apps out of the box.</p>

<p>I often want to create a “simple http server” to serve up the current
directory, usually I reach for <code class="highlighter-rouge">python -m SimpleHTTPServer</code>, but in the
spirit of re-inventing the wheel I decided to see how Go could handle
this task.</p>

<p>It turned out to be remarkably simple. Go comes with a static file server
as part of the <code class="highlighter-rouge">net/http</code> package, in this example I’ve added a couple of flags that
allow specifying the port and the root filesystem path for the process.</p>

<div class="language-go highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="c">// httpserver.go</span>
<span class="k">package</span> <span class="n">main</span>

<span class="k">import</span> <span class="p">(</span>
	<span class="s">"flag"</span>
	<span class="s">"net/http"</span>
<span class="p">)</span>

<span class="k">var</span> <span class="n">port</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">flag</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">String</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s">"port"</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s">"8080"</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s">"Define what TCP port to bind to"</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="k">var</span> <span class="n">root</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">flag</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">String</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s">"root"</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s">"."</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s">"Define the root filesystem path"</span><span class="p">)</span>

<span class="k">func</span> <span class="n">main</span><span class="p">()</span> <span class="p">{</span>
	<span class="n">flag</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">Parse</span><span class="p">()</span>
	<span class="nb">panic</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">http</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">ListenAndServe</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s">":"</span><span class="o">+*</span><span class="n">port</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">http</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">FileServer</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">http</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">Dir</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="o">*</span><span class="n">root</span><span class="p">))))</span>
<span class="p">}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The actual meat of the program is the second line inside the main
function. <code class="highlighter-rouge">http.ListenAndServe</code> accepts an address to listen on as the first argument,
and an object which implements the <code class="highlighter-rouge">http.Handler</code> interface as the second,
in this case <code class="highlighter-rouge">http.FileServer</code>. If
<code class="highlighter-rouge">ListenAndServe</code> returns an error (most likely because another process
is using the desired port) then the process will <code class="highlighter-rouge">panic</code> and exit.</p>

<p>If you’ve got Go installed then this can be run directly.</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>$ go run httpserver.go
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Or you can compile it to a standalone binary.</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>$ go build httpserver.go
$ ./httpserver
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The file server implementation that Go provides even handles serving <code class="highlighter-rouge">index.html</code>
from a directory if no file is specified, and provides a directory
listing if there is no <code class="highlighter-rouge">index.html</code> present.</p>

<p>For more details check out <a href="http://golang.org/src/pkg/net/http/fs.go?s=12008:12048#L401">Go’s implementation of <code class="highlighter-rouge">http.FileServer</code></a>.</p>

    <p class="post-date">Monday 31 December 2012</p>
  </header>

  <div class="post-content">
    
<p>I’ve been playing with my <a href="http://www.skpang.co.uk/catalog/starter-kita-for-raspberry-pi-pi-not-include-p-1070.html">Raspberry Pi starter kit</a> today. It comes with a clear plastic case for mounting the Pi onto, but as I’ve already got a case I’m just using the breadboard and the components that were supplied with the kit. As well as the breadboard the kit includes the following components:</p>

<ul>
  <li>12 × LEDs (4 each of Red, Yellow and Green)</li>
  <li>12 × 330Ω resistors (for the LEDs)</li>
  <li>2 × 10kΩ resistors</li>
  <li>2 × mini push buttons</li>
  <li>10 × male to female jumper wires</li>
</ul>

<p>The example I was following is for a <a href="http://www.skpang.co.uk/blog/archives/656">simple traffic lights system</a>.
The hardware components are wired into the Raspberry Pi board using its
<a href="http://elinux.org/RPi_Low-level_peripherals#General_Purpose_Input.2FOutput_.28GPIO.29">GPIO pins</a>. These General Purpose Input Output pins can be
controlled using software so they provide a simple way to connect to
external hardware to the Pi.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In addition to the familiar USB, Ethernet and HDMI ports, the R-Pi
offers lower-level interfaces intended to connect more directly with
chips and subsystem modules.
<small><a href="http://elinux.org/RPi_Low-level_peripherals#Introduction">RPi Low-level peripherals introduction</a></small></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Once I got the traffic lights wired up and working I started hacking
on the software side of things. The <a href="http://skpang.co.uk/dl/traffic_light_rev_2.py">example python code</a> didn’t cleanup
the GPIO when I pressed <code class="highlighter-rouge">ctrl-c</code>, so the lights remained in the position
they were in when I interrupted the process. To fix this I <a href="https://github.com/chrismytton/rpi-traffic_lights/blob/a6fba162d11679bd3daaeb9a8adca2b223092152/traffic_light_rev_2.py#L34-L42">installed a
signal handler</a> to run the GPIO cleanup code and exit cleanly.</p>

<div class="language-python highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">cleanup_gpio</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">signal</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">frame</span><span class="p">):</span>

<span class="c1"># Install signal handler to cleanup GPIO when user sends SIGINT

</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The code I’ve been tinkering with is <a href="https://github.com/chrismytton/rpi-traffic_lights">on
GitHub</a>. This includes the example
C code, which is pretty much untouched other than adding a limit to the
number of loops so that the GPIO cleanup code gets run. There’s also the
example python code which is what I’ve mainly been playing with.</p>

<p>There is a <a href="https://github.com/chrismytton/rpi-traffic_lights/blob/a6fba162d11679bd3daaeb9a8adca2b223092152/disco.py">disco.py</a> file in the repository that flashes the lights in
sequence which is essentially a modified version of the traffic lights script.</p>

<p>For my first attempt at Raspberry Pi hacking this was very successful,
it’s a real buzz to see hardware and software coming together in
something of your own making.</p>

<p>The next stage of this project will involve linking this traffic light
system into a web service to create a status indicator.</p>

    <p class="post-date">Monday 17 December 2012</p>

  <div class="post-content">
    
<p>For a while now my shell has been taking a <em>very</em> long time to start up. It
wasn’t so noticeable on more powerful machines, but on my late 2010
MacBook Air with “only” 2GB of RAM, it was very noticeable.</p>

<p>Last weekend I decided to finally sit down and figure out what was causing the
slow startup times. I stepped through the startup process in my <a href="https://github.com/chrismytton/dotfiles">dotfiles</a>,
commenting out lines until it was fast again, it didn’t take long to find
the offending line in my <code class="highlighter-rouge">zshrc</code>.</p>

<div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="k">for </span>module <span class="o">(</span><span class="nv">$DOTFILES</span>/<span class="k">**</span>/<span class="k">*</span>.zsh<span class="o">)</span> <span class="nb">source</span> <span class="s2">"</span><span class="nv">$module</span><span class="s2">"</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This line uses shell globbing to load up all the files that end in <code class="highlighter-rouge">.zsh</code> in
the dotfiles repo, its pretty central to the way the dotfiles work, without
it no custom zsh scripts are loaded. So how could this line be causing such
a slow startup?</p>

<p>The way <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glob_(programming)">globbing</a> works is it expands the pattern into a list of
files. In this case it checks all the files in the dotfiles directory to
see if they end with <code class="highlighter-rouge">.zsh</code>.</p>

<p>This shouldn’t be a problem, but I had configured my vim plugins
to be installed into a directory within the dotfiles repo, which had its
contents gitignored, you can see <a href="https://github.com/chrismytton/dotfiles/commit/5c497a86f3535bad6c31a93a617598879fc9cd58">the commit</a> on GitHub. This meant I
could install vim plugins without having to track them in the repo. So
the shell globbing was checking all of the files in the vim plugins as
well as the dotfiles.</p>

<p>To solve this problem I spent an hour removing my vim configuration from my dotfiles and putting it
into its <a href="https://github.com/chrismytton/dotvim">own repository</a>. I’d wanted to do this for a while anyway because I found myself
changing my vim configuration a lot more than anything else in the dotfiles.</p>

<p>I made this change on my faster work laptop, which doesn’t suffer as much with the
slow startup. When I got round to pulling the
changes down to my Air the difference was <em>very</em> noticeable, new
shells pop into existence in under a second, like they should.</p>

<p>It’s been 6 months since I made the commit which began the slowdown. I’ve been putting up with
slow shell startups for all that time, when actually it only took a
couple of hours in total to identify and fix the problem.</p>

<p>So don’t be like me and ignore performance problems when you know
they’re there, take the time to fix them</p>

<p>I take great pleasure in reducing the size of a codebase.</p>

<p>When you first start a project there is a lot of code churn. As your
understanding of a problem changes the code changes and grows with it.</p>

<p>As time goes on you need to remove code that is no longer used. One
strategy that I often see is commenting the offending code out. This
adds a lot of noise to the code when you’re reading it, a much better
strategy is to just remove the unused code, if you need it back you can
ask your VCS.</p>

<p>When you don’t take the time to remove old code and features, it’s often
more confusing when you come to add new code and features.</p>

    <p class="post-date">Friday 13 January 2012</p>
  </header>

  <div class="post-content">
    
<p>Recently I found myself wanting to access the resque-web ui on a live
application. I had considered just running resque-web as a separate process,
but after reading <a href="http://blog.kiskolabs.com/post/776939029/rails3-resque-devise">this article</a>
I realised that I could mount resque directly in the router, awesome!</p>

<p>However, the application doesn’t use devise for authentication, so I wanted an
easy way to restrict resque-web to admins.</p>

<p>Using rails 3 router’s <a href="http://guides.rubyonrails.org/routing.html#advanced-constraints">advanced constraints</a>
you can pass a <code class="highlighter-rouge">:constraints</code> options with an object that responds to
<code class="highlighter-rouge">matches?</code> and receives the current request as an argument.</p>

<p>Since the current user’s id is stored in the session, we can simply
retrieve the user and check if they’re an admin.</p>

<div class="language-ruby highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="k">class</span> <span class="nc">AdminRestriction</span>
  <span class="k">def</span> <span class="nc">self</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="nf">matches?</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">request</span><span class="p">)</span>

    <span class="k">return</span> <span class="n">user</span> <span class="o">&amp;&amp;</span> <span class="n">user</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">admin?</span>
  <span class="k">end</span>
<span class="k">end</span>

<span class="no">MyApplication</span><span class="o">::</span><span class="no">Application</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">routes</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">draw</span> <span class="k">do</span>
  <span class="n">mount</span> <span class="no">Resque</span><span class="o">::</span><span class="no">Server</span> <span class="o">=&gt;</span> <span class="s1">'/resque'</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="ss">:constraints</span> <span class="o">=&gt;</span> <span class="no">AdminRestriction</span>
  <span class="c1"># Other application routes.</span>
<span class="k">end</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The <code class="highlighter-rouge">AdminRestriction</code> class performs the actual checks, in the router
it is simply passed as a constraint.</p>

<p>First we pull the <code class="highlighter-rouge">user_id</code> out of the session, then we attempt to get
the user from the database. Finally we check that we’ve found a user and
that they are an admin.</p>

<p>If the user tries to access <code class="highlighter-rouge">/resque</code> and they are not an admin, they
simply get a 404 error.</p>

<p>This technique can be used with any rack application, or indeed with any
regular route, just pass a <code class="highlighter-rouge">:constraints</code> option (see the
<a href="http://api.rubyonrails.org/classes/ActionDispatch/Routing/Mapper/Base.html#method-i-match">match method docs</a>),
and the constraints that you apply can use any part of the request to decide if
it matches. You can restrict access by ip address, or do routing based
on the request’s geolocation.</p>

<p>The possibilities are endless.</p>

    <p class="post-date">Tuesday 22 March 2011</p>
  </header>

  <div class="post-content">
    
<p>Start at the top level with a user requirement. This will ensure that you are trying to solve the right problem in the first place.</p>

<h2 id="cucumber--steak">Cucumber / Steak</h2>

<p>Write a simple high level requirement in cucumber or steak. For example
if you were writing an api and you wanted to allow people to post
activity.</p>

<p>First you would write out the requirement in plain english.</p>

<div class="language-gherkin highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="kd">Feature</span><span class="p">:</span> Creating activity
  As an activity producer
  I want to post activity to the api
  In order to share it with the world

  <span class="kn">Scenario</span><span class="p">:</span> POST to /activity
    <span class="nf">Given </span>I am an authorized activity producer
    <span class="nf">When </span>I post some activity
    <span class="nf">Then </span>I should receive a 200 success status
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This defines the high level picture of what the application aims to
achieve. From this point the next step is to write some steps to
properly test that the features are working.</p>

<p>Obviously the features won’t be working yet, because that’s not how
test/behaviour/real-world driven development works. If you start writing
code before you really know what you are building, then it is likely
that you will at some point, perhaps without realising, implement the
wrong feature. More likely though, being that smart martin that you
are, you will implement the correct feature, but unwittingly leave a bug
in it. No harm, you say, bugs happen in software and it’s probably only
one line of code that needs changing. But if the bug doesn’t manifest
itself for a few days, weeks, months, then it will take an ever
increasing amount of time for you to track it down. Then once you have
isolated it, you have to ensure it won’t happen again.</p>

<p>This all comes down to testing. If you can easily run a bank of tests
that confirm that your application is behaving at night you will,
infact, sleep better at night. For some this is reason enough to write
tests, but wait, there’s more. If you have a comprehensive collection of
tests you can use to verify that your application is working correctly,
then you are in a very good position to do some refactoring. No more
worrying if you’ve broken some seemingly unrelated piece of
functionality when you make a change to the application.</p>

<h2 id="controller-tests">Controller tests</h2>

<p>The next layer down the stack is the controller, this makes sense, since
this is the layer that manages incoming requests. So after writing the
initial acceptance test in a high level language, then implementing the
steps necessary to test this logic in a slightly lower level language,
you now drop down to a relativly granular level. This is where you start
to stub out the main functionality of the application. So in the case of
our activity example above, you would at this stage be stubbing out the
functionality of the models, and just dealong with the way that
controllers handle requests.</p>

<p>This layer may be preceeded by another, slightly higher level one in
which the routing for the application is set up, however this is quite a
web application specific area.</p>

<h2 id="model-tests">Model tests</h2>

<p>The model tests are the core of the testing universe, they are very
small, low level details about the various methods that a model
provides.</p>

<p>The model tests are the most important tests, as they contain the
business logic for your application. But they are often also the easiest
tests to write. This is because a lot of the time you will be dealing
with primitive data types. No external services to worry about. This is
a good reason to push as much logic into the model as possible, it is
far easier to test this that it is to put it in your controller then try
to stub it out.</p>

<h2 id="other-tests">Other tests</h2>

<p>All of this testing malarkey is great and everything, but sometimes you
have got to just use the product to uncover random bugs, but don’t
worry, that’s not to say we can’t still use testing to help us. Instead
of jumping right in and fixing that bug like a good boy scout
hacker, write a failing test that reproduces the bug. This test may
exists as (m)any layer(s) of the test stack. Often you will need to
write a test in the acceptance layer to perform the same interaction
that caused the bug, then once that has caught the bug, go down the
layers and write tests for the code paths that the bug touches, these
failing tests will then (all going to plan) be green once you have fixed
the bug, and as a billy bonus you’ve got yourself another test or two
that will ensure many good nights sleep in the future.</p>

<h2 id="final-thoughts">Final thoughts</h2>

<p>The testing pattern of development is still not used as a default
development technique. Many (most) tutorials you find out there will
focus on the functionality that they are trying to tutor you on, but a
vital part of implementing any functionality is to ensure a long
lifespan by testing it thoroughly.</p>
